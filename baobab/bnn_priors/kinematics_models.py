    """Evaluate the velocity dispersion function from the fit on SDSS DR6
    by [1]_ on a provided grid and normalizes the result to unity, so it can 
    be used as a PMF from which to draw the velocity dispersion.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vel_disp_grid : array-like
        a grid of velocity dispersion values in km/s

    Note
    ----
    The returned array is normalized to unity and we treat it as a PMF from which to sample
    the velocity dispersion. We also use the exact fit values also used in LensPop ([2]_).
